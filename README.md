# Packing Problem
This program provides the best possible configuration to pack various 'packages' into one or more 'containers'.

## Using the program
1. Set a container by providing the height and width
2. Add packages of any height and width
3. See the packages packed into as few containers as possible

New containers will be added as needed to accomodate all the packages.

Packages can be named for clarity and edited at any time

Container and package data can be imported and exported to a text file to save states.

## Uses
I made this program to determine how many foam boards I needed to mount about 30 posters of mostly unique sizes. I figured there's probably some mathematics I could use, but I'm a programmer, not a mathematician, so I wrote a program instead. I imagine this program could be used to map out floor plans or any number of other semi-annoying tasks.
